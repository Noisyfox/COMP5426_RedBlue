# COMP5426_RedBlue
The Red/Blue computation for COMP5426

# Assignment description

**The Red/Blue computation** simulates two interactive flows: an n by n board is initialized so cells
have one of three colors: red, white, and blue, where white is empty, red moves right, and blue
moves down. (The board may be initialized with roughly 1/3 cells in read, 1/3 in white and 1/3 in
blue and colors should be interleaved and spread across the board. You need to write a separate
function *board_init* to initialize the board.) In the first half step of an iteration, any red color
can move right one cell if the cell to the right is unoccupied (white); on the second half step,
any blue color can move down one cell if the cell below it is unoccupied (white); the case where
red vacates a cell (first half) and blue moves into it (second half) is okay.  Colors wraparound
to the opposite side when reaching the edge. Viewing the board as overlaid with a *t* by *t* grid of
tiles (for simplicity *t* divides *n*, i.e., every tile contains *n/t* by *n/t* cells), the computation
terminates if any tile’s colored cells are more than *c%* one color (blue or red).

- Use MPI to write a solution to the Red/Blue computation.
- Assume the processes are organized as a one-dimensional linear array.
- It is fine to use a square grid, i.e. *n* by *n* grid for *n* being grid size.
- For simplicity assume *n* is divisible by *t*.
- Each process will hold a number of *k×n/t* rows for *k* ≥ 0.
- For the purpose of load balancing, processes should have roughly the same number of rows and
the difference not greater than *n/t* rows.
- Your program must produce correct results for *nprocs* being greater than or equal to one.
- Your program needs to ask for 4 user defined parameters (integers) as inputs: cell grid size *n*,
tile grid size *t*, terminating threshold *c*, and maximum number of iterations *max_iters*.
- Your program needs to print out which tile (or tiles if more than one) has the colored squares
more than *c%* one color (blue or red).
- After the parallel computation, you main program must conduct a self-checking, i.e., first
perform a sequential computation using the same data set and then compare the two results.
